# AirQualityMadrid-Forecast

The goal of this project is to forecast how the air quality in Madrid will continue if the conditions we have now remain.
We also wanted to study how the different policies made by the government affected air pollution.

This project was done by Camila Barbagallo, Paula García, Juan Gil de Gomez and Rocío González Lantero.
